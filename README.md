# Gibbs sampler for Adaptive relaxed Spectral Regularization (GASR)
###Introduction
This is the C++ code for implementing the GASR algorithm in the paper: 
> Yang Song, Jun Zhu, *Bayesian Matrix Completion via Adaptive Relaxed Spectral Regularization*, to appear in AAAI 2016.

There is also a similar [Scala version](https://github.com/hjss06/GASR-Scala) (which is slower than this C++ version).
